    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Any headings can be used but it is a good practice to use the heading hierarchically.</li>
        <li>The level of heading is for semantic.</li>
        <li>The size should be modified using the style attribute or by changing CSS for all.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Different headings should be placed in the order without skipping.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It seems that a good practice is <code>h2</code> heading for slide/section headings
            <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> for presentation title and <code>h3</code>
            for subtitles.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>bullet (unordered) list are done by <code>ul</code></li>
        <li>numbered (ordered) list are done by <code>ol</code></li>
        <li>nested lists
            <ol>
                <li>nested list font size is smaller</li>
                <li>works the same for bullet and numbered lists</li>
                <li>you should pay attention to nesting elements
                    <ul>
                        <li>nested list must be inside <code>li</code> element</li>
                        <li>if the HTML is not valid the styles will not work</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            description lists and their elements (<code>dl</code>, <code>dt</code>, <code>dd</code>)
            do not have any special handing
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Any web page can be embedded</h2>
    <iframe src="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass71/manuals/r.slope.aspect.html"
        width="542" height="450px" seamless class="top">
    </iframe>
    <ul>
        <li>
            online pages to avoid screenshots or switching to different window to show a web page
            <ul>
                <li>
                    by controlling the embedded web page you loose control over the slides
                    <ul>
                        <li>you need to click to the slide to associate keyboard with slides again</li>
                        <li>you may consider enabling the control arrows (<code>controls</code>) for Reveal.js</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>mind the risk of not having internet access</li>
                <li>note that if the slides are online with <code>https</code>, websites with <code>http</code> will not show</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>offline pages for embedding some HTML document which we don't want to integrate</li>

    <h2>Test slides to fit screens</h2>
    <p>
        With all kind of slides you need to take care of their size
        which unlike non-HTML presentations is not fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that a web browser window has different aspect ratio then
        the full screen where the presentation will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Test your slides with different ratios, new screens and
        projectors have 16:9, 16:10 and the classic ration is 4:3.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Mozilla Firefox has responsive design view
        (Tools > Web Developer > Responsive Design View)
        where you can try different rations, e.g. 4:3 can be tested
        as 800x600. You can also save few useful ones.
